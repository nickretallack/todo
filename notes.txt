Always store time in the database as GMT.  Be sure to remember this when querying and displaying.
This way, stuff can be dropped in from the server without thinking.  And I'll be familiar enough with the issue that I'm less likely to make a mistake when I eventually sync stuff over the web.






- Sync

I'm interested in how MobWrite implements synchronization.  I would consider every database record (excluding virtual tables) to be an individual document.  Every document needs a shadow copy which stores what it looked like before it was modified, as well as a dirty flag so I know it needs to by synchronized.

I could store the shadow copy by serializing the record's data into a single column.  This column could reside in the same table as the data itself, and thus appear in every table, or I could make another table that stores a serialized representation of every other object.  In fact, no database features are needed for this, so it could be implemented easily enough in localstorage.  I am leaning toward adding the column to every table, though.



- Small Worries:
What if Math.uuid ever collides?  Should I be checking for this?
