- add laundry lists in the right panel when no events are focused
    - add a 'close' button to focused event to unfocus it

- make sure you can't enter duplicate tasks.  Search for the text first,
    - and if it already exists, return it


- full text search supports the *, which makes my stemming totally irrelevant.
    - toss stemming column in the database
    - keep function around for javascript implementation
        - might just use autocomplete's implementation


- Implement this with sqlite first for simplicity.
    Maybe try to hack it without that later on

- Would be really nice to have a proper map, instead of this jquery each
    - perhaps I should look at closure, or underscore?

    
- Although it's a convention in CSS to use hyphens for spaces,
this is not a valid identifier in JavaScript, so to be consistent, I will use
underscores everywhere.  (Also, hyphens break John Resig's template system.)
